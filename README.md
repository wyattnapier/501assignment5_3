# 501 Assignment 5-3

### Assignment Description

Create a 4 page app that helps you explore the city with proper navigation

### AI Usage

I used AI to refactor my original navigation into a NavGraph file which worked well.
I also used it for the custom routes which created some issues with the Home button not working.
The custom routes made it so that my original conditional statement wasn't ever properly evaluated,
but I made it more dynamic which resolved the issue. Overall, AI was pretty helpful with navigation
and it even fixed the problems it created although Gemini is much worse than ChatGPT or other
alternatives.
